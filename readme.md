It starts with a common french gym word, after 3 seconds it will swap to the english translation. 

If you didn't know it click cross, if you did click the tick.

The original file is called french_words and the app will create a new csv called french_words_to_learn. I had Gemini create the list of words so it might be slightly inaccurate.

If 3 seconds isn't the right length of time for you, you can change it in the flip_timer variable in lines 24 and 40 of main.py, it's set to 3000ms so change as needed.
